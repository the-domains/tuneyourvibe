# Physics-Based Biology

Quantum biology is changing the way we look at health. As we view the body/mind through 21st-century quantum goggles, we see a highly structured collection of electromagnetic fields and oscillating wave forms, giving rise to the physical manifestation of Us. In NES, we call this highly structured energetic scaffolding the body-field.

## The Body's OS

The body-field is the body/mind's operating system, and supports all the processes that occur in your body. When functioning in alignment, the body-field orchestrates harmonious balance in your body and mind, and encourages the body's own ability to heal and stay healthy.

Energy medicine in its many forms - from acupuncture or qi gong to aromatherapy or prayer - supports growth and change in the energetic realm, from which our physical structure emanates. NES Health is one of the leading energy-based therapies in the world, and  provides a highly effective method for interacting with and providing support for underlying energy structures in the body.

## NES Health - One Million Scans and Counting...

For more than fourteen
years, health practitioners around the world have been helping people get well
and stay well with NES Health.  ![](https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/5ecb2b4fcba182636cb2759f84d84a9c/passthrough.jpg?height=373&input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2F1a92e9b0b05cb818778c539d12b46c54d03b44ed.jpg&width=444)

NES Health sessions
begin with a fast, non-invasive scan which provides a way to measure the
functionality of your body-field. The body-field is an energetic matrix created
by your body from energy it both produces and gathers from the
environment.

The NES scan detects
energetic fluctuations occurring in the body/mind in a way that allows us to
support the field where change or growth is occurring.

## Field Support

Targeted and sequenced
field support based on scan readings begin with the appropriate Infoceutical(r),
which are drops taken in water, containing colloidal minerals
imprinted with  energetic information. These informational data sets provide alignment
instruction to the body-field, and have a rejuvenating energetic effect.

The NES miHealth device is also used off-body in sessions to encourage the process of  restoring information to and rejuvenating the HBF. By correcting energetic field damage, your body's inherent ability to heal itself is restored, and harmonious balance returns to body and mind.
