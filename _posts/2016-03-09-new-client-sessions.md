For more than fourteen
years, health practitioners around the world have been helping people get well
and stay well with NES Health.  

NES Health sessions
begin with a fast, non-invasive scan which provides a way to measure the
functionality of your body-field. The body-field is an energetic matrix created
by your body from energy it both produces and gathers from the
environment.

The NES scan detects
energetic fluctuations occurring in the body/mind in a way that allows us to
support the field where change or growth is occurring. Targeted and sequenced
field support based on scan readings begin with the appropriate Infoceutical(r),
which are drops taken in water, containing colloidal minerals
imprinted with  energetic information. These informational data sets provide alignment
instruction to the body-field, and have a rejuvenating energetic effect.

# The Body's OS

The body-field is the body/mind's operating system, and supports all the processes that occur in your body. When functioning in alignment, the body-field orchestrates harmonious balance in your body and mind, and encourages the body's own ability to heal and stay healthy, and can be damaged by all manner of trauma, stress, toxins, injury, and radiation exposure. When functioning in alignment, the body-field orchestrates harmonious balance in your body and mind, and encourages the body's own ability to heal and stay healthy. ![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/e772c7074a6b97d550cdff0b526453a9843ecdd5.jpg)

The NES miHealth device is also used off-body in sessions to encourage the process of  restoring information to and rejuvenating the HBF. By correcting energetic field damage, your body's inherent ability to heal itself is restored, and harmonious balance returns to body and mind.
