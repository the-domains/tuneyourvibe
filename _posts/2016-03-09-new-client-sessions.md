# Energy + Information = Life

Quantum biology is changing the way we look at health. As we view the body/mind through 21st-century quantum goggles, we see a highly structured collection of electromagnetic fields and oscillating wave forms, all carrying information, giving rise to the physical manifestation of Us. In NES, we call this highly structured energetic scaffolding the body-field.

## The Body's OS

The body-field can be thought of as the operating system, supporting all the processing that occurs in the hardware of your body. When functioning in alignment, the body-field orchestrates harmonious balance in your body and mind, and encourages the body's own ability to heal and be well.

Energy medicine in its many forms provides new alignment opportunities that promote growth on all levels.

NES is perfectly suited to this role, as its detailed mapping of the body-field allows for sequenced, highly directed support for the underlying energy structures of the body.

## NES Health - One Million Scans and Counting...

For more than fourteen years, health practitioners around the world have been helping people get well and stay well with NES Health. 

NES Health sessions begin with a fast, non-invasive scan which detects energetic fluctuations occurring in the body/mind, allowing us to support the field where change and growth are occurring.

## Field Support

Targeted and sequenced field support based on scan readings begins with the appropriate Infoceutical(r), which are drops taken in water, containing colloidal minerals imprinted with energetic information. These informational data sets provide alignment instruction to the body-field, and can have a rejuvenating energetic effect.

The NES miHealth device is also used in the home and in-office sessions to encourage the process of restoring information to and rejuvenating the body-field.

# Wellness from Anywhere

The first ever remote wellness system from NES Health connects clients to practitioners from anywhere in the world. The small, portable scanning devices can be used at home, or taken along on travel.

Clients need a scanning device (see below), a Windows or Mac computer running the NES Desktop software, and an internet connection to transmit scans. For more information, send inquiries to debbie@tuneyourvibe.com.

## Typical remote scan sessions include:

On the day of your scheduled session:

1\. You perform and transmit the scan.

2\. We connect through a Zoom online meeting or Skype. I'll share my screen, and we'll walk through your scan elements together.

3\. We discuss an Infoceutical protocol and, if applicable, a miHealth protocol for the current cycle.

4\. Infoceuticals are shipped, scan details are delivered to you; you are empowered.

## Scanning Devices

There are three options for you to manage your own NES Health experience. All three devices perform scans; the miHealth devices have additional functionality.

1\.**Professional miHealth device** - professional version of the world-class NES Health miHealth PEMF device. Information sets based on NES' body-field mapping are embedded in friendly frequencies that rejuvenate and restore communication in the body-field. Can be used on- or off-body. Professional version has all available functions. Training included.

2\. **Client miHealth device** - same as pro but with limited programs; designed to work with a remote practitioner who loads custom functions each cycle. Training included.

3\. **Client Remote Scanner** - a simple scanning device that plugs into the USB port on a Windows or Mac computer running the NES Desktop software. It's small and portable (about the size of a computer mouse); a great way to stay energetically supported during travels.
