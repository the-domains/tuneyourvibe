# Energy + Information = Life

Quantum biology is changing the way we look at health. As we view the body/mind through 21st-century quantum goggles, we see a highly structured collection of electromagnetic fields and oscillating wave forms, all carrying information, giving rise to the physical manifestation of Us. In NES, we call this highly structured energetic scaffolding the body-field.

## The Body's OS

The body-field is the body/mind's operating system, and supports all the processes that occur in your hardware. When functioning in alignment, the body-field orchestrates harmonious balance in your body and mind, and encourages the body's own ability to heal and stay healthy.

Energy medicine in its many forms - from acupuncture or qi gong to aromatherapy or prayer - supports growth and change in the energetic realm, from which our physical structure emanates. NES Health is one of the leading energy-based therapies in the world, and  provides a highly effective method for interacting with and providing support for underlying energy structures in the body.

## NES Health - One Million Scans and Counting...

For more than fourteen
years, health practitioners around the world have been helping people get well
and stay well with NES Health.  

NES Health sessions
begin with a fast, non-invasive scan which provides a way to measure the
functionality of your body-field. The body-field is an energetic matrix created from energy the body both produces and gathers from the
environment.

The NES scan detects
energetic fluctuations occurring in the body/mind in a way that allows us to
support the field where change or growth is occurring.

## Field Support

Targeted and sequenced
field support based on scan readings begin with the appropriate Infoceutical(r),
which are drops taken in water, containing colloidal minerals
imprinted with  energetic information. These informational data sets provide alignment
instruction to the body-field, and can have a rejuvenating energetic effect.

The NES miHealth device is also used in the home and in-office sessions to encourage the process of  restoring information to and rejuvenating the body-field. By correcting energetic field alignment, your body's inherent ability to heal itself is restored, and harmonious balance can return to body and mind.

# Wellness from Anywhere

The first ever remote wellness system from NES Health connects clients to practitioners from anywhere in the world. The small, portable scanning devices can be used at home, or taken along on travel.

Clients need a scanning device (see below), a Windows or Mac computer running the NES Desktop software, and an internet connection to transmit scans. Clients perform their own scans on the day of their scheduled session.

## Typical remote scan sessions include:

* On day of session, you perform and transmit the scan.
* We connect through a Zoom online meeting or Skype. I'll share my screen, and we'll walk through your scan elements together.
* We discuss an Infoceutical protocol and, if applicable, a miHealth protocol for the current cycle
* Infoceuticals are shipped, scan details are delivered to you; you are empowered.

## Scanning Devices

There are three options for folks to manage their own NES Health experience. All three devices perform scans; the miHealth devices have additional functionality.

1\.**Professional miHealth device** - professional version of the world-class NES Health miHealth PEMF device. Information sets based on NES' body-field mapping are embedded in friendly frequencies that rejuvenate and restore communication in the body-field. Can be used on- or off-body. Professional version has all available functions. Training included.

2\. **Client miHealth device** - same as pro but with limited programs; designed to work with a remote practitioner who loads custom functions each cycle. Training included.

3\. **Client Remote Scanner** - a simple scanning device that plugs into the USB port on a Windows or Mac computer running the NES Desktop software. It's small and portable (about the size of a computer mouse); great way to stay energetically supported during travels.
