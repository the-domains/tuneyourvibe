"...Genetic determinism also led to the belief that genes control our health, the characteristics of our health, our behavior, and our emotions.... A gene is the blueprint. Blueprints do not turn on and off.... Turns out today it is apparent that one percent or less of disease issues on this planet is actually connected to genes." -Cell biologist Bruce Lipton

In his stunning work, _The Biology of Belief, _Bruce Lipton explains Epigenetics, the new understanding that the environment (the world we perceive) controls the expression of genes and, subsequently, how our bodies function, or don't.

Ultimately, awareness of what drives our perception is key to understanding our path to wellness. In this lively and interesting discussion with Alan Steinfield, Dr. Lipton breaks it way down.
