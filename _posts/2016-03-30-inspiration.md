"We are the feedback loop of information for the universe to learn about itself." -[Physicist Nassim Haramein][0]

Nassim is credited with the most accurate calculation of the charge radius of the proton, a measurement which reveals that each proton within every molecule of our bodies (and all matter) has the mass of a black hole! This is significant because black holes 1) are connected to all other black holes; and 2) each holographically/fractally contain all mass and information in the entire Universe. This is physics, proving the spiritual concept "We are all One". I love this, also, because it means we each have within us access to all information available in existence. We are only limited by our own beliefs (see Inspiration post with Dr. Bruce Lipton).
