"...Genetic determinism also led to the belief that genes control our health, the characteristics of our health, our behavior, and our emotions.... A gene is the blueprint. Blueprints do not turn on and off.... Turns out today it is apparent that one percent or less of disease issues on this planet is actually connected to genes." -Cell biologist Bruce Lipton
