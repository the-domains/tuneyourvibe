"...Genetic
determinism also led to the belief that genes control our health, the
characteristics of our health, our behavior, and our emotions.... A gene
is the blueprint. Blueprints do not turn on and off....Turns out today it is apparent that one percent or less of disease issues on
this planet is actually connected to genes." -Cell biologist Bruce Lipton

In
his stunning work, _The
Biology of Belief, _Bruce
Lipton explains Epigenetics, the new understanding that the environment (the
world we live in and our perception and beliefs about the world) controls the
expression of genes and, subsequently, how our bodies function, or don't.
Change your perception, and your body chemistry changes. How fabulous is that?
Be empowered.
