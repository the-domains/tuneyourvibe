"We live in an infinite universe with infinite boundaries." -Physicist Nassim Haramein (academy.resonance.is/)

Nassim is credited with the most accurate calculation of the charge radius of the proton, which shows how each proton within every molecule of our bodies (and all matter) is a black hole. This is significant because black holes are 1) connected to all other black holes; and 2) each contain all mass and information in the entire Universe. This is physics, proving the spiritual concept "We are all One". I love this, also, because it means we each have within us access to all information, all understanding available in existence. We are only limited by our own beliefs. -dlv
