"We live in an infinite universe with infinite boundaries." -Physicist Nassim Haramein

Nassim is credited with the most accurate calculation of the charge radius of the proton, which shows how each proton within every molecule of our bodies (and all matter) is a black hole. This is significant because black holes are 1) connected to all other black holes; and 2) each contain all mass and information in the entire Universe. This is physics, proving the spiritual concept "We are all One". I love this, also, because it means we each have within us access to all information available in existence. We are only limited by our own beliefs (see Inspiration post with Dr. Bruce Lipton).
