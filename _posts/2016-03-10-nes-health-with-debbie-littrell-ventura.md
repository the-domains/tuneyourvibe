# NES Health with Debbie Littrell Ventura

As a NES Health Certified Practitioner, I've had the honor and extreme pleasure of walking 

I've worked as a professional in the legal technology field for more than twenty years. My great love and passion, however, is the study and application of bioenergetic and informational healthcare. I knew when I first discovered NES that it was revolutionary and held the potential to change the way we understand energy and information in relation to well-being.  I also intuitively knew that if anything could help my loved ones suffering from debilitating illnesses and their treatments, it was this amazing therapeutic system.

After a prolonged chronic illness and journey back to health (you can read about that **[here][0]**), I received a degree in Homeopathy from the Texas Institute for Homeopathy in San Antonio, Texas, and subsequently gained certification as a NES Health ProVision practitioner. I see clients in my office in the centrally located just north of downtown, and also work remotely with clients across the country.
