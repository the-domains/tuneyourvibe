# NES Health with Debbie Littrell Ventura

As a NES Health Certified Practitioner, I've had the honor and extreme pleasure of walking alongside many others in their wellness journeys. I've cheered as my clients have rekindled their creative fires; cried as I've witnessed transformation of profound suffering; encouraged as the paths unfolded; and squealed with joy as pains subsided, stresses ebbed, and life became new again.

I've learned that the body is not the enemy; that we are always - always! - striving toward wholeness. When we lose energetic coherence, whether through trauma or prolonged stress, the body begins to adapt to the changes in our energetic structure in an effort to continue carrying out our wishes. In my own experience, these adaptations - pain, changes in stamina or mobility, tolerance to the environment, mood swings and distress - are messages from within that something has changed and needs our conscious attention. 

I've worked as a professional in the legal technology field for more than twenty years. My great love and passion, however, is the study and application of bioenergetic and informational healthcare. I knew when I first discovered NES that it was revolutionary and held the potential to change the way we understand energy and information in relation to well-being.  I also intuitively knew that if anything could help my loved ones suffering from debilitating illnesses and their treatments, it was this amazing therapeutic system.

After a prolonged chronic illness and journey back to health (you can read about that below), I received a degree in Homeopathy from the Texas Institute for Homeopathy in San Antonio, Texas, and subsequently gained certification as a NES Health practitioner. I see clients in my office in the centrally located just north of downtown, and also work remotely with clients across the country.
