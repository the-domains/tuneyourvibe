# Seeing the Unseen

When LIGO scientists confirmed last week their detection of gravitational waves in the wake of merging black holes, it meant two things to regular folk: science can now see something it couldn't, and science must now acknowledge the existence of other types of energy fields, even though they are officially as yet undetectable.

This is important if you're interested in wellness. Our most effective, efficient, and safe forms of medicine are energy-based with long histories and proven track records (see Traditional Chinese Medicine, Ayurveda, and Homeopathy, biofeedback). Yet, for the countless stories of healing, thousands of years of documenting, and a century of modern study, conventional medical science has resisted embracing its older and wiser sibling.

Luckily, some stalwart and brilliant researchers forged ahead and created things like NES Health, a unique state-of-the-art technology that interacts with the quantum electrodynamic (QED) fields emanated by every cell, tissue, and organ in the body. Through this field-level interaction, the body's operating system is optimized, stimulating innate healing function and balance, all without side effects.

As conventional medical science awakens to the world of teeming waveforms in which it swims, what is today still largely ignored as unseen will change the way medicine works. More people than ever before will have access to these kinds of highly effective and incredibly safe forms of healthcare, based entirely on the energetic emanation of the Human body-field.
